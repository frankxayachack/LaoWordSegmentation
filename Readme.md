# [ຕັດຄຳລາວ] Lao Word-Segmentation

Lao is written in a continuum. Space is never or at least rarely used character in Lao language, so this software will do the job to seperate single word from the input file and give the result to output file.

# Techniques
  - Separate every single syllable 
  - Combine syllables to a meaningful word using Dictionary-based
  - The technique gives more than 98% result (separate syllable - yet the word depends on the dictionary)

# Developed on

  - Java 8
  - IntelliJ
